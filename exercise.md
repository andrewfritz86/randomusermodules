#PersonPrinter

Create a simple Express App that:
- Allows users to click a button that generates a small profile for a random Human
- A Human should have the attributes of name, gender, nationality and a photo
- Use a constructor function to stamp out instances of Human objects!

**Bonus**
- Use module.exports to organize your code into relevant files and minimize your use of the global namespace
- Hook your app up to a database and persist Humans
  - CRUD them!
- Implement routes to show all male or female Humans
